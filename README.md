# JoomlaSitePlanner

Joomla Site Planner is a Joomla component designed to help agencies, or individuals, gather website content.

When content is added to a Joomla website using either Joomla articles or K2 articles website managers indicate
the type of assets the page needs such as words, photos etc using a series of radio buttons. The component then draws a dynamic site map. Each node (or page) on the site map indicates, using red, green and grey icons, the content that a page has and the content it requires to finish it. The overall map provides visual feedback about the content required to finish the site.

The component also allows content to be emailed simply by clicking the nodes.

The content types are user definable.
The email address to receive content is user definable.

-------------------------------------

The package consists of a component, two plugins (one for content and one for k2 items) and a template for viewing the site map in the front end on a full screen.

Individual installers for each can be found in the packages sub folder.

The pkg_siteplanner.zip installs them all.

Running build.sh (from the root of the project) will re-create all the install files (linux/mac only).
